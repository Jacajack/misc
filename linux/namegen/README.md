# namegen

Random name generator. Generates random names based on a provided template list.

Usage:
`namegen COUNT TEMPLATE [TEMPLATES]`

If count is less than 1, the program generates infinite list of words and awaits for character input after each one.

The template describes layout of vowels and consonants in words to be generated. Each vowel in the template will correspond to a vowel in generated words. Same holds for consonants.
